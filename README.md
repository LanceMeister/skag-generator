# skag-generator
A python tool for generating Single Keyword Ad Groups (SKAGs) templates for Google Ads. SKAGs are a popular way to structure Google Ads for granular detail and analysis of various keyword and ad copy combinations, however it can be time consuming to setup.

This tool uses a simple excel template input that once populated and the script has run, produces the various combinations of ad groups, keywords and ads that can then be bulk uploaded into Google Ads Editor.
